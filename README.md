Simple PHP-based Timeclock System for Logging Attendance

This repo contains the necessary PHP scripts that will log attendance using a MySQL-based database.

To use, first make sure you have two databases created, one called "intern" and one called "timelog".
The scripts will create and fill these databases as new users are created.
